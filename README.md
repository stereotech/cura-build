# STE Slicer Build

This repository contains build scripts used to build Ste Slicer and all dependencies from scratch.

The build has a number of dependencies. Ideally, these dependencies should be installed by the
[cura-build-environment](https://github.com/Ultimaker/cura-build-environment) repository. Even
with cura-build-environment though, some things may still be missing from your system that we
haven't thought of.

# Build with Docker (Linux and Windows)

To build STE Slicer releases for Windows, you can use the `cura-build-environment` docker
images. Check the [repository](https://github.com/stereotech/cura-build-environment) for more
details on how to build the docker images on Windows.
